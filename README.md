hi im tabtray (🤯)

i am a male 'developer'. all repositories seen on this profile are passion projects, thus do not expect stability

im proficient in lua/luau and making websites look pretty, given time. anything outside of that, ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, dont expect anything grand out of me

im welcome to help anyone with something im knowledgable in

## active projects

basically all of my projects are in stasis right now. im trying to figure out how to linus my torvalds and gnu my linux so that has taken over me wholly :/

(arch btw)

## https://tabtray.neocities.org

my website/neocity whatever you wanna call it

right now its pretty out of date so maybe dont look too closely at it - ill get to updating it soon. hopefully.
