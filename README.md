i am a male 'developer' that does not know what a git is. all repositories seen on this profile are passion projects, thus do not expect stability

known/learning languages (sorted by confidence): 
- Lua/Luau, 
- C#, 
- HTML, CSS, JS

im welcome to help anyone with something im knowledgable in (eg. roblox scripting, source map making)

## active projects

basically all of my projects are in stasis right now. im trying to figure out how to linus my torvalds and gnu my linux so that has taken over me wholly :/
